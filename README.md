# dotfiles

Configuration files I use on my desktop, laptop, and EC2 server.

Install with `[sudo] ./install.sh <desktop|laptop|headless>`

Running with or without root privileges determines whether or not certain
things are installed, or where they're installed. For example, on desktop and
laptop, fonts are not installed without root privileges. Read the install.sh
bash script for details.
